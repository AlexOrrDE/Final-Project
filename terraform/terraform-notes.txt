We need to make sure that the .terraform folder is in the .gitignore, or we will have problems when pushing.

We used the security credentials found on the IAM page/ make access key (need to change these later) and stored them locally

We added a .gitkeep file to the layer/python folder as it is otherwise empty

To fill out the layer/python folder we need to pip install there with (check this command)

pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./layer/python

As of writing the requirements.txt file only has pg8000

In the lambda.tf file we have set specific runtimes for Python. These are required for a zip file but we can change them to be more recent ones probably.

When setting up the scheduler (in eventbridge.tf), according to 

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/scheduler_schedule

the role_arn is the role for the scheduler itself (not the lambda as it might seem). It links to 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/setting-up.html#setting-up-execution-role

which gives the execution role for the scheduler. In iam.tf we make an eventbridge role (this doesn't let it use the lambda yet, it just makes a role).

The JSON we need to actually allow use of the lambda is given here:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/setting-up.html#setting-up-execution-role

step 3 (lambda invoke box).

Finally 

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-iam-policy

tells us how to turn this into a policy and attach this to the eventbridge role.
