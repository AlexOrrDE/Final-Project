We need to make sure that the .terraform folder is in the .gitignore, or we will have problems when pushing.

We used the security credentials found on the IAM page/ make access key (need to change these later) and stored them locally

We added a .gitkeep file to the layer/python folder as it is otherwise empty

To fill out the layer/python folder we need to pip install there with (check this command)

pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./layer/python

As of writing the requirements.txt file only has pg8000

In the lambda.tf file we have set specific runtimes for Python. These are required for a zip file but we can change them to be more recent ones probably.
